# Timeline_Generation_Final_Year_Project
A project I completed during my final year of college that generates a timeline from a list of user inputted events.


Application to automatically generate a timeline.

Start application by running Application.java

Or

Run jar file by executing the following command in the project directory: java -jar timeline_generation_fyp.jar

OR

Double click the jar file to run it.

Two jar files for the project have been provided, one was specifically developed to run the project on a Mac

A few sample timelines have been provided by going to File -> upload -> select the CSV file containing the timeline.
